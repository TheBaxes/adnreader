abstract = "The basic reconstruction problem lead with the general task of retrieving a scenery from observations made by a random walker. A critical factor associated with the problem is reconstructing the scenery in polynomial time. In this article, we propose a novel technique based on the modern \{DNA\} sequencing method for reconstructing a 3-color scenery of length n . The idea is first to reconstruct small pieces of length order log n and then assembled them together to form the required piece. We show that this reconstruction and assembly for a finite piece of a 3-color scenery takes polynomial amount of time. "
